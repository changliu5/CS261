Push 16 items into a 8 space array cost 16+8 = 32 units, Push 32 items cost 32+8+16 = 56 units. O(1+).

Push 16 items cost 72 units, 32 items cost 260 units. O(n).

If you are going to push 16 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out at capacity 8, anytime you push 9 elements, you pop 1 element, than the big oh will be O(n^2). You can change the shrinking policy to shrink when array is 30% full or less.
